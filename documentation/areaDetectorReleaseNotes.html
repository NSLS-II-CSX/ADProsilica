<h2 align="center">Release 1-1 (6-May-2008)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Major rewrite.  Converted device drivers and plugins from C to C++ with
      C++ base classes that handle many of the details of asyn and of
      callbacks and threading for plugins.
  <li>Everything except device drivers and top-level EPICS databases and
      channel access clients are now fully N-dimensional, not restricted to
      2-D.
  <li>NDPluginFile now uses netCDF format, which is a portable self-describing
      binary file format.
  <li>Added NDPluginROI which implements region-of-interest.
</ul>
